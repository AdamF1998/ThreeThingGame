# ThreeThingGame
Walking, Inventions and Learning...
This project is the end result of a Programming Game Jam that lasted for 24 hours. Information about the event can be found here:
https://threethinggame.com/page/about/. I was in a team of 2 others, and none of us knew how to use unity before we started the event.
The event turned out being very enjoyable and we were able to create a 2D platformer game.

The three words we were given were Walking, inventions and learning. Our idea was to create a platformer game where you walk through levels
that are based on a specific time era with a prolific invention which would also provide some information which would introduce the
learning.
This platformer game has 3 levels which are based on different
time eras with an invention. The aim of the game is to reach the end of all the levels to complete the game. This game is a bit like Dark
Souls in the sense that it is very difficult to complete due to deaths respawning you at the beginning of the first level again. We felt like
this made the game more enjoyable as the more times we failed, the more we wanted to complete the game.
